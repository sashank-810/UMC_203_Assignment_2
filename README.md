# AIML Assignment 2 â€“ IISc 2025

This repository contains my submission for Assignment 2 of the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course at IISc (March 2025). The assignment consists of three questions involving implementation and analysis of machine learning algorithms on real-world datasets.

## âœ… Attempted Questions

### Question 1 â€“ Support Vector Machine and Perceptron

- Investigated the separability of the CIFAR-100 dataset using the Perceptron algorithm.
- Implemented soft-margin linear SVMs (primal and dual) using `cvxopt`, and compared runtimes.
- Identified non-separable images using SVM, removed them, and retrained the Perceptron to demonstrate convergence.
- Implemented a kernelized SVM with a Gaussian kernel (C=10, Î³=100), achieving 0% misclassification.

### Question 2 â€“ Logistic Regression, MLP, CNN & PCA

- Applied classification techniques to a subset of the MNIST-JPG dataset.
- Trained an MLP on flattened 28x28 images with three hidden layers (512, 256, 128).
- Designed a CNN with two convolutional layers followed by a dense classifier.
- Performed PCA for dimensionality reduction (117 components).
- Retrained MLP and Logistic Regression using PCA features.
- Evaluated all models using confusion matrices, classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score), and ROC-AUC curves.

### Question 3 â€“ Regression

#### 3.1 Linear and Ridge Regression
- Implemented Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge Regression.
- Analyzed performance using MSE on two datasets.
- Discussed rank deficiency and regularization.
- Saved optimal weight vectors to CSV files.

#### 3.2 Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Used historical stock price data for ticker `BAC`.
- Implemented both linear and kernelized SVR (RBF kernel, Î³ âˆˆ {1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001}) for t âˆˆ {7, 30, 90}.
- Visualized predicted vs actual stock prices and moving averages across all models.
